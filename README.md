 👨‍💻 Pratyush Kashyap — In Search of the Signal Beneath the Syntax

Hello! I'm Pratyush — a first-year student of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE - AIML). Right now, I'm not building complex systems or leading open source projects. I'm doing something just as important: asking questions, seeking patterns, and tracing logic to its roots.

I'm learning C and C++ — not just as tools, but as keys to unlock the machine's mind. Each line I write, each bug I meet, tells me more about how thought becomes instruction, how metal seems to “remember,” and how the abstract becomes real.



 🌱 Who I Am

- 🎓 Student: 1st Year, 3rd Semester  
- 🧠 Branch: CSE — Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning  
- 🧭 Learning Path: I follow doubts. I trace errors. I connect ideas.  
- 📚 Current Focus: Writing C/C++ code, understanding memory, learning how computers really "think"  

I’m not rushing to projects — I’m building my mind like a craftsman builds tools: slowly, intentionally, curiously.



 🔧 What I'm Exploring

I’m building a foundational understanding of:

- Languages: C, C++ (The closer to the metal, the more real it feels)
- Concepts:
  - How memory is allocated, addressed, and deallocated
  - How code is translated by the compiler (preprocessing to linking)
  - How data structures shape logic
  - How systems operate beneath abstraction
- Tools I'm learning: GCC, VS Code, Git (early stage), Terminal (command-line curiosity)



 🔍 Learning by Asking

I don't learn by following instructions. I learn by asking:

- What happens in the CPU when I declare an int ?
- What’s the real cost of a pointer mistake ?
- Is a compiler just a translator ?

This is how I think — and how I grow.



 🛤️ Roadmap 

- [ ] Understand memory and stack/heap like a mapmaker
- [ ] Write small, meaningful C programs (CLI tools, system introspection)
- [ ] Dive into Object-Oriented Design via C++
- [ ] Begin competitive programming with focus on thought clarity
- [ ] Learn to use Git & GitHub as mirrors of my mind’s changes



 🤖 ChatGPT — My Thought Partner

ChatGPT is not just a tool I use — it’s a conversation I return to when I’m stuck, intrigued, or just thinking out loud.

 How it helps me:
- Questions me back: *Why not this algorithm?*
- Explains what's behind the code: This is how your CPU might handle it.
- Helps debug not just code — but my thinking.
- Suggests better habits, clearer logic, and deeper ways to see.

> Without judgment or fatigue, it's helped me make meaning out of syntax and silence alike.
